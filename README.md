# 🎮 Hangman Game – C++  

🚀 **Ever wondered how game functionality is brought to life?** Dive into the world of **C++ programming** with this exciting project! We've recreated the classic **Hangman game**, showcasing the **power and elegance** of C++ techniques.  

From **intricate loops** and **dynamic arrays** to **modular functions** and **efficient file handling**, every line of code is crafted to deliver a **seamless gaming experience**.

## 🕹️ Game Overview  
Hangman is a **word-guessing game** where players try to guess a hidden word by selecting one letter at a time. If the player guesses wrong too many times, they lose!  

✅ **User Input** – Guess letters to reveal the hidden word.  
🔄 **Looping Mechanism** – Ensures smooth and replayable gameplay.  
📂 **File Handling** – Saves and loads game progress seamlessly.  
🧠 **Dynamic Word Selection** – Randomly selects words from a predefined list.  
🔧 **Modular Code** – Clean and structured using functions.  

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- **C++** – Core language for game logic and implementation.  
- **Loops & Arrays** – Efficiently handle game rules and logic.  
- **File Handling** – Saves and loads game history.

## 🎮 How to Play  
1️⃣ **Clone the repository:**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Hangman-Game.git
   cd Hangman-Game
   ```

2️⃣ **Compile the C++ program:**  
   ```sh
   g++ hangman.cpp -o hangman
   ```

3️⃣ **Run the game:**  
   ```sh
   ./hangman
   ```

4️⃣ **Game Instructions:**  
   - The program selects a **random word** from a list.  
   - The player guesses one letter at a time.  
   - Incorrect guesses reduce the number of attempts.  
   - The game ends when the word is guessed or attempts run out.

## 📌 Example Output  
```
Welcome to Hangman!
Word: _ _ _ _ _ _
Enter your guess: A
Good guess! The word so far: _ A _ _ _ _
```
